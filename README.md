# Notes :

## Use Semantic Elements (ex: main , section , nav , button).

## Use Meta tags for SEO.

## Use CSS Variables

## Don't Forget box-sizing property

## Try not to use CDN to prevent the issues that happen when the CDN is down.

## Remind me to tell you how to use images from Figma.

## Review all the comments line by line in both index.html and style.css

## Just edit the things I told you to edit
